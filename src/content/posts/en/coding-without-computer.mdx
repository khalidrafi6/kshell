Many people want to learn programming but can't because they don't have a computer. Good news for them: you can learn programming using just your mobile phone. Let’s see how:

## 1. Online Code Editors and Compilers

The easiest way to code on a mobile device is by using online code editors and compilers. Search for terms like _online code editor_ or _online compiler_ in your search engine (or ask an AI chatbot), and you’ll find many options, such as [CodePen](http://codepen.io/), which is a front-end web development environment. The advantage is that you can code directly from your browser without installing any additional apps. Even if your mobile device isn’t high-end, you can still manage. However, your phone must support internet browsing. If you struggle to find a code editor or compiler that supports your programming language, try searching with the specific programming language name.

## 2. Code Editor Apps

Apart from web-based options, there are many code editor apps available for Android. In my opinion, the best options are:

- [Emacs](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.emacs/)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#android)

Both are cross-platform, so you can use the same editor everywhere. Emacs is relatively easier to use. You can simply change the keybindings if they feel hard. Neovim has a learning curve but it a is very powerful editor if you can master it. To run Neovim, you’ll need [Termux](https://termux.com/). For both editors, you can find detailed instructions on their respective websites. Feel free to ask me if you need help.

For convenience, you can buy a separate keyboard and use it with your phone via USB OTG. A keyboard will make programming much easier. Alternatively, you can install one of the following:

- [Unexpected Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/packages/juloo.keyboard2/)
- [Hacker's Keyboard](https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard)

These apps allow you to use a computer-like keyboard on your mobile device.

There are many other code editor apps on the Play Store, but most are tagged _Contains ads_, which I don’t prefer. However, I found one ad-free app called [Code Studio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alif.ide). You can try it out.

Additionally, there are apps for learning programming, such as [Hyperskill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hyperskill.app.android). These apps offer programming courses designed to be engaging, helping you stay motivated. Features like scoring and notifications will keep you inspired to learn coding.
