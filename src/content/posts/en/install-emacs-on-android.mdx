[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a nice editor for coding on Android. It is cross-platform and officially supported. So, you get the advantage of using the same code editor on all your devices without extra hacks (unlike VSCode). If you want to [code without a computer](/en/coding-without-computer), this is the best choice. I know of no other code editor for Android which is also supported on desktops and as powerful as Emacs is. You can use packages like `git`, `python` etc. in it via [Termux](https://termux.dev/). The publisher of Emacs describes it as follows:

> Emacs is the advanced, extensible, customizable, self-documenting editor

So, its main features are:

- **Advanced:** Emacs can do more than just basic text editing - it can indent automatically, show multiple files, edit remote files, and much more.

- **Self-documenting:** From within the editor itself, you can use help commands to find out what any command does, or to find all commands related to a given topic.

- **Customizable:** You can easily change the behaviour of its commands.

- **Extensible:** Besides changing commands, you can also create new commands with the Lisp language.

Actually, in Emacs, you can do much more than just code editing. You can browse the web, read email or news, perform calculations, make plans and more. You might end up uninstalling many other apps on your phone after starting to use Emacs! By programming with [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html) or installing [packages](https://elpa.gnu.org/) made by others, you can make it do many things that a traditional editor can't.

Alright, let's dive in to installing Emacs on Android. There are three methods to install it on Android. Among them, I recommend [installing Emacs with Termux support](#installation-with-termux-support).

## Installation

### General Installation

This is the easiest and most straightforward method. You simply download the app from official source and install it. But, you wouldn't get additional packages such as `git`, `ssh`, `python` etc. For simple code editing tasks, you can go with this method:

1. Visit [your nearest GNU mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android) or the [main GNU FTP server](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android).

2. Download a package according to the CPU architecture and Android version of your phone.

3. Now, install the `.apk` file. Grant permission to install from unknown source if asked.

**Note:** There is also another version available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). But it's older from the official one. And it lacks bug fixes and new features. So, you're better off with the official APK.

### Installation with Termux support

You can also install Emacs with Termux support. Termux is a terminal emulator which lets you use a Linux environment on Android without rooting. So you can get an awesome coding environment thanks to Linux packages ported for Android in Termux repository. This gives Emacs access to crucial tools such as `git`, `clang`, `python`, `fish` etc. I recommend this method because it enhances your coding experience by interfacing with Termux. For this to work, you need a Termux package signed with the same key as Emacs. The Emacs developers already provide such packages. Here's the complete process:

1. Remove any existing copy of Termux and Emacs from your phone.

2. Install Termux from [this source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/termux-app_apt-android-7-release_universal.apk/download) _first_.

3. Then install Emacs from your [nearest mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android) or the [FTP server](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android). You must install the package from `termux/` dir.

4. Now, run the following in Termux:

```shell
$ pkg update && pkg upgrade
```
Confirm each of the inquiries accordingly. 

5. After all the packages are installed and updated, open Emacs and add the following code into `~/.emacs.d/early-init.el` (read more about Early Init File in [Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html)):

```elisp
(setenv "PATH" (format "%s:%s" "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin"
                        (getenv "PATH")))
(push "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin" exec-path)
```
This will add the Termux binary path to Emacs' `exec-path` exposing packages from Termux to it.

Now, restart Emacs. You should be able to access programs in Termux from Emacs now.

**Note:** Any future updates of Emacs or Termux (and plugins) must be signed with the same key. For packages downloaded from other sources, you must sign them with that key available at:

https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/java/emacs.keystore

### Installing from Termux Repository

You can also install Emacs directly from the Termux repository. Then you can launch Emacs from inside Termux. Install it with the command:

```shell
pkg install emacs
```

However, in my opinion, the official app is better. Because it runs as a native Android GUI program within the Android system and it has better support for Android. On the other hand, Emacs from Termux is not a separate Android app. Rather, it is a package of Termux.

## Getting Started

> ðŸ’¡ *You can also check out [my Emacs configuration](https://git.khalidrafi.me/configs/.emacs.d). If you don't have enough time to read the following, you can start using my [barebones.el](https://git.khalidrafi.me/configs/.emalongsideacs.d/src/branch/main/barebones.el) file as your [Init File](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html). This file has almost all the configurations below enabled, with some exceptions. I've added comments to all my files for easier understanding. So, you'll find proper information even for the exceptions. There are also useful configurations in other files of my configuration besides `barebones.el`. So, I recommend looking at all the files there.*

### Keyboard Notation in Emacs

<div align="center">

| Notation | Key Meaning    |
|:--------:|:--------------:|
| `ESC`    | ESCAPE         |
| `M`      | META (ALT)     |
| `C`      | CTRL (CONTROL) |
| `S`      | SHIFT          |
| `SPC`    | SPACE          |
| `RET`    | RETURN (ENTER) |
| `DEL`    | DELETE         |

</div>

Example: `C-s` = `CTRL-s`, `M-x` = `META-x`, `S-d` = `SHIFT-d`, `C-M-DEL` = `CTRL-META-DELETE`, `C-x C-z` = `CTRL-x CTRL-z`

### Customizing Emacs on Android

The best way to [customize](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html) Emacs on Android is via the [Easy Customization Interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html). It can be accessed through the menu bar: **Options > Customize Emacs**. There are many options in that menu. You can start with **Top-level Customization Group** which is basically the *home* of **Easy Customization Interface**. There is also a search bar at the top of the interface for searching settings. You can also search using the **All Settings Matching** option. 

Emacs can also be customized with an [initialization file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html) (or "init file" for short). Emacs searches for the init file using filenames `~/.emacs.el`, `~/.emacs`, or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` in that order. You can write [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html#SEC_Contents) expressions in this file to configure Emacs. These expressions are function names followed by arguments and surrounded by parentheses. For example, to auto-save a file 5 seconds after you stop typing, you would change the value of `auto-save-timeout` variable with `setq`:

```elisp
(setq auto-save-timeout 5)
```

To display modifier bar, you would call the minor mode command `modifier-bar-mode` with argument `1`:

```elisp
(modifier-bar-mode 1)
```

For more details about Init File syntax, [refer to Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Syntax.html). Furthermore, if you need to run any command before the Init File loads, you can use the [Early Init File](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html), which [we did earlier in the installation process](#installation-with-termux-support).

Besides, you can run any command by typing `M-x` (or **Edit > Execute command** from menu bar). For example, if you type `M-x customize` and press `Enter`, the **Top-level Emacs Customization Group** will appear, because `customize` is the command for **Easy Customization Interface**. Additionally, you can find commands using tab completion.

### Grant Storage Permissions to Emacs

Emacs by default has access to its app data directory (usually `/data/data/org.gnu.emacs/files`) which is used as its home directory. But, it also needs to access your internal storage (located at `/sdcard`) to open and edit files from there. For Android 11+:

1. Go to the **Apps** section in **Settings**.

2. Then, go to **Special App Access** option. 

3. Find out Emacs in the app list and enable **All files access** for it there. 

For Android versions lower than 11, you can allow storage permission from **Permissions** menu in **App Info**. 

You can also provide Emacs access to storage provided by other apps (cloud storage apps for example). To do this, execute `android-request-directory-access` command. Then, choose the corresponding storage and your desired directory from the selection panel.

### Set up GUI elements or bars

If you want to use Emacs on Android without a physical keyboard, GUI elements like menu bar and tool bar will be your best friends. So, enable all of them as you need from `Customize`. One very useful option for Android is the modifier bar beneath the tool bar of Emacs. It contains buttons for the modifier keys (e.g. `CTRL`, `ALT`, `META` etc.) understood by Emacs. You can enable it with `modifier-bar-mode` when `tool-bar-mode` is on. When you tap any of the modifier keys, Emacs will also display the on-screen keyboard and temporarily disable text conversion to let you use modifiers in a Text or Prog mode buffer. You can set `tool-bar-position` to `bottom` to get those keys near your fingers.

### Always display on-screen keyboard

Emacs on Android hides on-screen keyboard in read-only buffers by default to save screen space. You can usually perform actions from the menu bar or tool bar what you would otherwise do with a keyboard. But, having the keyboard is still very useful. Turn on `touch-screen-display-keyboard` in `Customize` to always display the keyboard. 

### Enable support for keybindings of some packages

Some Emacs packages (e.g. [Evil](https://melpa.org/#/evil)) that rely on globally reading raw key events / keybindings don't work with Android's on-screen keyboard. This is because Android input methods rely on Emacs' text conversion style which lets it implement some features like auto-fill, electric-pair etc. If you use any package that can't work because of this, disable text conversion globally with the variable `overriding-text-conversion-style` or disable it locally per buffer with `text-conversion-style` variable.

### Terminal and Shell

You can use terminal and shell from within Emacs. For that, Emacs has the following commands:

- **Terminal:**
  - `term`
  - `ansi-term`

- **Shell:**
  - `shell`
  - `eshell`

Terminals can take input directly from the keyboard, which allows for features like using up arrow to see previous commands. On the other hand, shell only takes input from the buffer, so it doesn't have some of the terminals' features. If you need special character support (like colored output), you must use `ansi-term`. Lastly, `eshell` is a command interpreter similar to `shell` but written in Emacs Lisp.

### Opening files with Emacs

When you try to open a file on Android, it asks which app to use. To open files with Emacs, you need to enable the Emacs server. Run `M-x server start` to start the server from inside Emacs. Running the server automatically at startup would be very convenient for you. To do that, simply add `(server-start)` to your [initialization file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html).


### Improve readability and editing experience

Enable `visual-line-mode` to edit lines based on their visual order, not logical order. Long lines when wrapped look like many lines though actually they are a single line. This mode changes simple editing commands to act on those visual lines and also enables word-wrap in the corresponding buffer. Thus it helps you read and edit better on Android.  Enable it from **Options > Line Wrapping in this Buffer > Word Wrap (Visual Line Mode)**. You can also enable it for all buffers globally with `global-visual-line-mode`. You can also enable `visual-wrap-prefix-mode` to indent wrapped lines. You may also look into the following:

- [Visual fill](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/visual-fill.html)

- [Adaptive filling](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Adaptive-Fill.html)

- [Adaptive wrap](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/adaptive-wrap.html)

### Configuring fonts

You can set default font in Emacs with the `set-frame-font` function like so:

```elisp
(set-frame-font "JetBrains Mono")
```

You can also set fonts from the **Faces** group in `Customize`. There are various subgroups under that group for font faces used in different areas of Emacs. Start with the `Basic Faces` subgroup and customize others as necessary.

If your primary font does not support your local language, you need to add a language-specific font to the fontset. For example, you can use the following code in your Init File for Bangla language:

```elisp
(set-fontset-font "fontset-default" nil "Noto Sans Bengali" nil 'prepend)
```

According to this Elisp expression, Emacs will use the specified font Noto Sans Bengali for rendering Bangla language. This font is usually pre-installed on Android phones. However, if the font you want to use is not on your device, you can create a folder named `fonts` in Emacs' home directory and copy the font files there. But remember, only `.ttf` is supported at this moment.

### Beyond Code Editing

As I mentioned earlier, you can do much more in Emacs than just code editing. You might think - _a code editor's job is coding, why do everything in it!_ However, while coding, it is annoying to leave the editor for related works such as contacting your clients/colleagues, planning your works or finding out related info from the internet. It breaks your concentration. And because of this Emacs feature, you can use similar keybindings for those tasks. This is especially convenient when those tasks are related to programming.

Emacs comes with built-in packages for various tasks, and you can install more. Here are some examples of what you can do with Emacs: 

#### Task & Project Planning

You can use Org Mode to create and manage your tasks and plans in Emacs. Org Mode is a writing tool and task planner for Emacs. This feature often comes up in discussions about Emacs. Org is essentially a markup language - you can call it an alternative to Markdown. But its syntax is simpler than Markdown. Although you can use Org files in other editors, Emacs offers some smart features for it. For example, you can press `TAB` on a heading line in an Org file to hide the text and subheadings under it. Pressing `TAB` repeatedly will reveal the subheadings step by step. Pressing `S-TAB` anywhere in the Org Mode buffer will cycle through visibility levels of the headings for the entire buffer. Org files can also include source code blocks and therefore you can use it for technical documentation. Read the [relevant manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/org.html) to learn more about Org Mode.

#### Web Browsing

Emacs has a simple HTML-only web browser. It is called EWW. To use it, run `M-x eww`. It's great for quickly looking up information or reading documentation while coding. Websites often distract us with various elements - the browser's simple interface saves you from that. It doesn't support CSS or JavaScript.

#### Email & News Reading

You can read email and news in Emacs using Gnus (`M-x gnus`). Initially, Gnus used to be a Usenet-style newsreader. However, it can now also function as an email client, though its approach to reading mail is still similar to newsreader. Read the [Gnus manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/gnus.html) for details. You can also use the [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) package to read emails in Emacs.

#### Calendar & Diary

Emacs has a [Desk Calendar](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html) feature, which also includes a diary for recording events. You can use it to manage appointments and track time in your projects. Type `M-x calendar` to view the calendar. Press `q` to exit the calendar.

#### Reading Books

You can [even read books](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Document-View.html) in Emacs. It supports various file formats like PDF, OpenDocument, Microsoft Office, EPUB, PostScript (PS) etc.

#### File Manager

Emacs has its own file manager called [Dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html). It's very simple and useful for easily finding files while coding.

### Installing Packages

In Emacs, you can install packages to add new features. You can use the `package-install` command for this. However, the most convenient way is to use the package menu. Run `list-packages` command to enter that menu. There are several commands available here. For example, use `i` to mark for installation and `d` to mark for deletion, `x` to install/delete marked packages, press `?`/`RET` to view package descriptions, etc. By default. Emacs only downloads packages from two sources: [GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org/) and [NonGNU ELPA](https://elpa.nongnu.org/). However, you can add additional archives such as the popular [MELPA](https://melpa.org) archive. For that, change the value of the `package-archives`.

### Read Emacs Manuals

Emacs is a feature-packed editor and you will need help from time to time. The best way to get help when you're stuck is to _help yourself_ with manuals. Emacs comes with several manuals included in it:

- [The Emacs Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html)

- [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html)

- [Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html)

- and [other manuals](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/index.html)

You can read them from inside Emacs with `C-h i` or [online](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/index.html). `C-h r` opens the Emacs manual. Typing `i` inside a manual lets you look for topics which is very handy. You can easily find Android-related topics from the manual there. However, there's actually a separate section in the manual specifically for Android: [Appendix H Emacs and Android](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android.html). Especially, you can read the following sections from it:

- [Accessing Files from Other Programs on Android](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android-Document-Providers.html)

- [What Files Emacs Can Access on Android](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android-File-System.html)

- [Running Emacs under Android](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android-Environment.html)

- [Installing Extra Software on Android](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Android-Software.html)

- [Touchscreen Input and Virtual Keyboards](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Input.html)

- [Touchscreen Events](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Touchscreen-Events.html)

Also, don't forget to read the [Emacs Android README](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android/README). You can also learn more about various functions, variables, modes etc. and their values with `describe-*` commands like `describe-function`, `describe-mode`, `describe-variable` etc. Use `C-h` shortucts (e.g. `C-h v` for `describe-variable`). You can also type `M-x` or **File > Execute Command** to get started.
