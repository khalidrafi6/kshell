[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a nice editor for coding on Android. It is cross-platform and officially supported. So, you get the advantage of using the same code editor on all your devices without extra hacks (unlike VSCode). If you want to [code without a computer](/en/coding-without-computer), this is the best choice. I know of no other code editor for Android which is also supported on desktops and as powerful as Emacs is. You can use packages like git, python etc. in it via [Termux](https://termux.dev/). And, Emacs actually lets you do much more than just editing code. You can browse web, use terminal, calculate maths, make plans and many more. Chances are you will end up uninstalling many other apps on your phone after starting to use Emacs! It is extensible and customizable. So, you can make it do many stuffs a tradtional editor can't.

Alright, let's dive in to installing Emacs on Android. There are three methods to install it on Android. But, I will only cover two of them in this tutorial. I recommend [installing Emacs with Termux support](#installing-emacs-with-termux-support-recommended).

## Installation

### General Installation

This is the easiest and most straightforward method. You simply download the app from official source and install it. But, you wouldn't get additional packages such as git, ssh, python etc. For simple code editing tasks, you can go with this method:

1. Visit [your nearest GNU mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android) or the [main GNU FTP server](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android).

2. Download a package according to the CPU architecture and Android version of your phone.

3. Now, install the `.apk` file. Grant permission to install unknown apps if asked.

**N. B.:** There is also another version available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). But, it's older from the official one. It lacks bug fixes and new features. So, you're better off with the official APK.

### Installation with Termux support (Recommended)

You can also install Emacs with Termux support. This gives Emacs access to Termux packages such as git, clang, python, fish etc. I recommend this method because it enhances your coding experience by interfacing with Termux. For this to work, you need a Termux package signed with the same key as Emacs. The Emacs devs already provide such packages. This is the whole process:

1. Remove any existing copy of Termux and Emacs from your phone.

2. Install Termux from [this source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/termux-app_apt-android-7-release_universal.apk/download) _first_.

3. Then install Emacs from your [nearest mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android) or the [FTP server](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/android). You must install the package from `termux/` dir.

4. Now, run the following in Termux:

```shell
$ pkg update && pkg upgrade
```
Confirm each of the inquiries accordingly. 

5. After all the packages are installed and updated, open Emacs and add the following code into `.emacs.d/early-init.el` (read more about Early Init File in [Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html)):

```elisp
(setenv "PATH" (format "%s:%s" "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin"
                        (getenv "PATH")))
(push "/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin" exec-path)
```
This will add the Termux binary path to Emacs' environment variable letting it access packages from Termux.

Now, restart Emacs. You should be able to access programs in Termux from Emacs now.

### Installing from Termux Repository

You can also install Emacs directly from the Termux repository. Then you can launch Emacs from inside Termux. But, I prefer the officially provided app. It runs as a native Android GUI program and has better support for Android. I don't use Emacs from Termux and won't cover this method here. You can search online to find out the installation tutorial.

## Getting Started

### Customizing Emacs on Android

The best way to [customize](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html) Emacs on Android is via the [Easy Customization Interface](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html). It can be accessed through the menu bar: **Options > Customize Emacs**. There are many options in that menu. You can start with **Top-level Customization Group** which is basically the *home* of **Easy Customization Interface**. There is also a search bar at the top of the interface for searching settings. You can also search using the **All Settings Matching** option. 

Emacs can be customized with an [initialization file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html), too. It searches for the init file using filenames `~/.emacs.el`, `~/.emacs`, or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` in that order. You write Lisp expressions in that file to configure Emacs. Lisp expressions are function names followed by arguments and surrounded by parentheses. For example, to auto-save a file 5 seconds after you stop typing, you would change the value of `auto-save-timeout` variable with `setq`:

```elisp
(setq auto-save-timeout 5)
```

To display modifier bar, you would call the minor mode command `modifier-bar-mode` with argument `1`:

```elisp
(modifier-bar-mode 1)
```

For more details, [refer to Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Syntax.html)

### Grant Storage Permissions to Emacs

Emacs by default has access to its app data directory (usually `/data/data/org.gnu.emacs/files`) which is used as home directory. But, it also needs to access your internal storage (located at `/sdcard`) to open and edit files there. For Android 11+:

1. Go to the **Apps** section in **Settings**.

2. Then, go to **Special App Access** option. 

3. Find out Emacs in the app list and enable **All files access** for it there. 

For Android versions lower than 11, you can allow storage permission from **Permissions** menu in **App Info**. 

You can also give Emacs access to storage provided by other apps (cloud storage apps for example). To do this, execute `android-request-directory-access` command by going to **File > Execute command** from Emacs menu bar. Now, choose the corresponding storage and then your desired directory from the selection panel.

### Always display on-screen keyboard

Emacs on Android hides on-screen keyboard in read-only buffers by default to save screen space. You can usually perform actions from the menu bar or tool bar what you would otherwise do with a keyboard. But, having the keyboard is still very useful. Turn on `touch-screen-display-keyboard` in `Customize`. 

### Enable support for keybindings of some packages

Some Emacs packages (e.g. evil) that rely on globally reading raw key events / keybindings don't work with Android's on-screen keyboard. This is because Android input methods rely on Emacs' text conversion style which lets it implement some features like autofill, electric-pair etc. If you use any package that can't work because of this, disable text conversion globally with the variable `overriding-text-conversion-style` or disable it locally per buffer with `text-conversion-style`.

### Set up GUI elements or bars

If you want to use Emacs on Android without physical keyboard, GUI elements like menu bar and tool bar will be your best friends. So, enable both of them from `Customize`. One very useful option for Android is the modifier bar beneath the tool bar of Emacs. It contains buttons for the modifier keys (e.g. CTRL, ALT, META etc.) understood by Emacs. You can enable it with `modifier-bar-mode` when `tool-bar-mode` is on. When you tap any of the modifier keys, Emacs will also display the on-screen keyboard and temporarily disable text conversion to let you use them in a Text or Prog mode buffer. You can set `tool-bar-position` to `bottom` to get those keys near your fingers.

### Opening files with Emacs

When you try to open a file on Android, it asks which app to use. To open files with Emacs, you need to enable the Emacs server. Run `M-x server start` to start the server from inside Emacs. Running the server automatically at startup would be very convenient for you. To do that, simply add `(server-start)` to your [initialization file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html).


### Settings to improve readability and editing

Enable `visual-line-mode` to edit lines based on their visual order, not logical order. Long lines when wrapped look like many lines though actually they are a single line. This mode changes simple editing commands to act on visual lines and also enables word-wrap in the buffer. Thus helping you read and type better on Android. You can also enable `visual-wrap-prefix-mode` to indent wrapped lines. You may also look into the following:

- Visual wrap prefix mode

- [Visual fill](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/visual-fill.html)

- [Adaptive filling](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Adaptive-Fill.html)

- [Adaptive wrap](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/adaptive-wrap.html)

### Configuring fonts

You can set default font in Emacs with the `set-frame-font` function like so:

```elisp
(set-frame-font "JetBrains Mono")
```

You can also set fonts from the **Faces** group in `Customize`. There are various subgroups under that group for font faces used in different areas of Emacs. Start with the `Basic Faces` subgroup and customize others as necessary.



### Read Emacs Manuals

Emacs is a feature-packed editor and you will need help from time to time. The best way to get help when you're stuck is to _help yourself_ with manuals. Emacs comes with several manuals included in it:

- [The Emacs Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html)

- [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html)

- [Emacs Lisp Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html)

- and [other manuals](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/index.html)

You can read them from inside Emacs with `C-h i` or [online](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/index.html). `C-h r` opens the Emacs manual. Typing `i` inside a manual lets you look for topics which is very handy. You can also learn more about various functions, variables, modes etc. and their values with `describe-*` commands like `describe-function`, `describe-mode`, `describe-variable` etc. Simply type `M-x` or **File > Execute Command** to get started.
